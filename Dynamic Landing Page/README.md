## About

In this project I implemented several javascript concepts and techniques, such as usin Intersection Observer API to activate the current section on viewport.
Also I used javascript methods such as (Append, creatElement) to dynamiclly create the navigation menu. 

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
